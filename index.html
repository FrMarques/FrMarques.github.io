	<h1> My first web page </h1>
	<p> First exercise using HTML and CSS</p>
	<h2> Let's start! </h2>
	<p> > We begin by adjust our content. </p>
	<p> > We follow by changing style in CSS: <br>
	&emsp;- We 'painted' the title in green;<br>
	&emsp;- We adjusted the back drop to clear tone to highlight the text.</p>
	<p> Just to have a 'link' here I'm adding my former page <a href= "https://frankmarques.wordpress.com/"> "FrankMarques'blog" </a></p>

	<p>It's a blog that I started around 2010 and developed as a source of news about music that I like. It's written in Portuguese, with some articles translated to English, it has some exclusive interviews and a lot of news about music being released. Enjoy!</p>
